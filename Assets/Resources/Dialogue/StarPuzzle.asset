      Dialogue: In some regions, a star is an object used for marriage proposals.
        I heard a story about a big reptile that killed tons of people to acquire
        a star, brought it back to his land of lava, traversed the country, killing
        more people, and then proposed with the star to the Princess of some fun
        guys. ( *3*)
    Choices:
    - Form and take a fallen star.
    - Never mind.
